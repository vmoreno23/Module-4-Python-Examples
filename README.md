# Module-4-Python-Debug-Examples
Hello my name is Victor, I contributed to these programs. There are six Python code programs within this repository. Each example was given to me with bugs and the purpose of the assignment is to debug the programs. I debugged each program and I will include them here. To use each of the programs paste the program's code into a text editor with Python support, run the program, and follow any on screen instructions and the results will be provided. The bugged starter codes were provided by Professor Nathan Braun.

The first program's purpose was to ask a user for time (24 hour) follwed by how many hours the user would want to wait then display the added up time. After debugging the program, I was able to solve the errors and fix the problem. 

The second programs's purpose was similar to the first one as it asks the user for a time in 24 hours, and ask how many hours to wait then display the added up time. After a fix to the spelling, and debugging the program, I solved the errors that were presented to me. 

The third program's purpose was to create a variable that represents a time traveler's year of origin and display whether they are from the present (1900-2020), past (before 1900), or future (past 2020). After going through the debugging process, I successfully organized the code and fixed any errors that occurred. 

The fourth program's purpose was to create a collection of authors followed by the year they past away. Display the author's name followed by "died in" and the year they passed. We have not learned about lists in Python, but after researching how they work and what other unknown functions such as for loops, I was able to figure out a solution and fix the errors presented to me when trying to debug. 

The fifth program's purpose was to create a grading system where a user would input 3 exam scores and display the user's average score, a statement stating if they're passing, and the grade of the user based on a grading scale. This program was a bit tricky to solve, but after some time, I was satisfied with the final product of the program since I have debugged it. 

The last program's purpose was to greet the user (a possible pirate) based on their input. If the user's input was "Arrr!" they are greeted one way compared to any other input. After completing the debugging process I successfully solved the program and was able to obtain the correct outputs.
